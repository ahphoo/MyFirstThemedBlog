We store the result in a. To find the carries, we do a bitwise and/&amp; and leftshift by 1. We store this result in b. We repeat the above two steps until b is zero (we have no more bits to carry). Finally, we return a, which would then store the sum with carries.\nFor Python, negative integers have an infinite number of ones. For example, if we add -1 and 1, we would carry 1 an infinite number of times. So we must limit the number of carries by checking if a exceeds the maximum positive value of a 32-bit integer. If a exceeds 2^31 - 1, we have to tell Python to interpret the number as a signed integer. We can do this by using the tilde ~ operator. However in Python, the ~ operator flips all the bits. To get around this, we flip 32 bits of a using a mask, then invoke the ~ operator.\nComplexity Analysis\nTime: O(N)\nIn the worst case, we would have N - 1 carries.\nSpace: O(1)\nIn Python, we have constant variables for the bit mask and maximum positive 32-bit integer.

Create a dp array of length s + 1. dp[i] is true if the substring in s ending at index i-1 is a dictionary word. Hence, the zero index of dp represents the empty string, which is trivially a word in wordDict.
